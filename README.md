# Alegrify Consult (Front End)

Alegrify Consult was supposed to be a portal where psychologists/doctors could connect with 
regular Alegrify users and monitor their thoughts and feelings.
The project is front end only as it used the API from Alegrify.com and needed no server side rendering.

The initial setup was created with the [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/), so this might seem familiar.
